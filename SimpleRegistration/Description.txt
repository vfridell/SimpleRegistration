Registration system design
	We are designing a system to allow students to register for classes and need a back-end model and a service layer.

General Description
Let’s say we are wanting to allow students to bundle courses together into a shopping cart and then register for them all at once when they are ready. 
Design a framework object-oriented system to accomplish this. Do not worry about too many implementation details like security, thread safety, etc.

Stories:
A student can only have a single active shopping cart
As a student I can add or remove a course on my active shopping cart
As a student I can see what courses are in any of my shopping carts past or present
As a user I can get a list of available courses
As a student I can try to register all the courses in my active cart
As an admin I can see a listing of all students
